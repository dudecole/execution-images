## Python Requirements

### Python 3.8+

Python version 3.8 or newer will be required to utilize the tools in 
this document.  If the python version is older than 3.8, please consider
removing the older versions of Python before continuing, or consider
using `virtualenv` PyPi to customize your environment.

For the sake of this document, python3.9 will be used.


**STEP 1**

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed by running some of the following commands.

```console

## which versions of python3 are installed
yum list installed python3*


## what is the default python3 version?
python3 --version

## Verify python38(9) is installed
python39 --version
python38 --version

```

*_NOTE_*: If `python38` or `python39` is already installed, continue
to [STEP 3](#step-3).
